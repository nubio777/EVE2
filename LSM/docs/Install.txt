Installation:

This application can be installed according to the following script:

1) You do not need to install or use any database. All data consumed by the application are read from a single file (I've provided an example of this file within the "data" directory)
2) That file should be unzipped and placed it somewhere in the file system. Make sure it is readable by the user "tomcat"
3) Open conf/lsm.properties and update the value of "DATA_SOURCE" within that file (according to the location of the previous file).
4) Go to "webapps" directory in Tomcat installation. Create a directory called "lsm"
5) Compile the Dronsys module within Intellij. Copy the contents of the generated "LSM_artifact" onto the "lsm" directory previously created.
6) Start up Tomcat. The application can be accessed from the URL http://tomcat_ip/lsm/view/main.jsp?view=Map&team=-1
